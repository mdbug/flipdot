# AGENTS.md

Interactive art installation driving a **28×7 × 4-module flip-dot display** (28×28 effective, see `Panel`). A webcam feeds MediaPipe pose detection; the system switches between display "modes" based on whether a person is present, looking at the camera, and gesturing. The display can additionally be driven by Bluetooth game controllers, a browser web UI, and an AI agent (in-UI Claude chat or an external MCP client).

## Code layout

`flipdot.py` at the repo root is the single entry point and main loop. Everything else lives under the `app/` package:

- `app/core/` — the loop's decision logic, hardware-free and unit-tested: `ModeManager` (active mode + control source), `TransitionPolicy` (decides mode from pose/time), `InputHub` (`input_source.py`, merges input from all sources into a queue of pointer/click/action events), `action_dispatch` (applies queued actions to modes).
- `app/modes/` — one class per display mode (see list below) plus the renderer plumbing: `contracts.py` (`Frame`, `RenderContext`, `ModeRegistry`), `factory.py` (`create_mode_instances`), `registry.py` (`build_mode_registry` maps a mode id to a renderer callable).
- `app/infrastructure/` — I/O boundaries: `Camera`, `Panel` (flip-dot hardware), `WebServer` (FastAPI), `mcp_server.py` (AI tools), `chat.py` (Claude backend).
- `app/services/` — supporting logic: `human_pose`, `figure` (constructed pose-mode character from landmarks), `text`, `draw` (1-bit line/circle/point primitives), `image`, `transition`, `weather`, `worldcup`, `fps`, `controller`/`controller_mapping` (BLE gamepads), `sandbox`/`script_store` (scripted animations), `settings_store`/`chat_session_store` (persistence), `fonts/`.
- `web_ui/` — the browser console (static HTML/JS/CSS served by `WebServer`).
- `state/` — runtime persistence (settings, saved boards, scripts, chat sessions); excluded from deploy rsync.
- `flipPyDot/` — vendored fork of the flip-dot driver library (installed as the `flippydot` package); `Panel` (`app/infrastructure/panel.py`) wraps it.

## Architecture & data flow

There is no framework — `flipdot.py:main()` is a single hand-written loop. Each iteration:
1. `Camera.read_frame()` → `image.crop()` to square.
2. Poll the Bluetooth controllers (`ControllerHub`) and feed presses through `ControllerInputBridge` into the `InputHub`.
3. Run MediaPipe pose (`human_pose.get_human_pose`) — **unless** it can be skipped: during sleep hours, while a controller drives a UI-only mode (`CONTROLLER_DRIVEN_UI_MODES`), or while a script runs. Pose is the loop's biggest cost, so skipping it keeps controller/script frames fast. Feed results into the `InputHub`.
4. `dispatch_actions(...)` applies queued input events (filtered by `mode_manager.get_allowed_input_sources()`) to the relevant mode.
5. `TransitionPolicy.apply(...)` decides the active mode from pose state and the clock and returns a `TransitionState` (distance, angle, face-mesh results). It drives a gesture chain: eyes visible + close enough → SANDFALL (the silhouette gets lit eyes/mouth from face mesh when close); very close **while facing the camera** and held for `CARICATURE_ENTER_HOLD_SECONDS` (< `CARICATURE_ENTER_DISTANCE`, hysteresis exit above `CARICATURE_EXIT_DISTANCE` held for `CARICATURE_EXIT_HOLD_SECONDS`) → CARICATURE — whose face first appears at the viewer's real on-panel head position and grows to full size over `ENTRY_ZOOM_SECONDS` (see `caricature.py`), then shrinks back onto the head while the exit hold runs down (`caricature_exit_progress` on `RenderContext`) — and back to sandfall on backing away — the facing gate and holds exist because the single-frame distance estimate swings wildly when the viewer turns; no person for `POSE_TIMEOUT` → CLOCK; inside the sleep window → SLEEP. Menu/MCP-launched sandfall and caricature are exempt from the chain's presence/distance rules. The menu's POSE checkbox (`ModeManager.pose_enabled`) turns the whole auto chain on/off — entry is blocked and any chain-entered mode returns to clock. POSE mode still exists (MCP/menu-fallback) but is no longer auto-entered.
6. The `ModeRegistry` (a `CrossFadingModeRegistry`) renders the active mode from a `RenderContext` → a `Frame`, random-pixel blending from the previously displayed frame for `MODE_BLEND_SECONDS` (1 s) after every mode change; `Panel.update(dots)` serializes and writes to hardware.
7. If the web UI is enabled, `WebServer.publish_frame(...)` mirrors the frame to browsers; the loop then sleeps/spin-waits to honor the per-mode FPS cap.

**The frame is the universal data type:** a `np.zeros((HEIGHT, WIDTH), dtype=np.uint8)` array of 0/1 dot values. Every renderer takes a `RenderContext` and returns one. Use the `Frame = np.ndarray` alias from `app/modes/contracts.py`. `Panel.WIDTH`/`Panel.HEIGHT` are the source of truth for dimensions — never hardcode them.

**Control sources.** `ModeManager` tracks both the active mode and the active *control source* (`CONTROL_GESTURE` vs `CONTROL_CONTROLLER`). Connecting a controller switches the source to controller; with none connected it falls back to gesture. `get_allowed_input_sources(include_web=True)` is what gates which queued `InputHub` events actually drive the display (`web` is always allowed). Each mode has a per-mode FPS cap in `ModeManager.MAX_FPS`; `get_fps_limit()` returns 30 for the first 5s of a mode for responsive transitions.

**Modes** (`ModeManager.MODE_*`): `sleep`, `clock`, `pose`, `menu`, `paint`, `caricature`, `percussion`, `autodrum`, `beatmirror`, `tetris`, `pong`, `tank`, `worldcup`, `board`, `font_preview`, `script`, `life`, `sandfall`. To add a mode: define a `MODE_*` constant + `MAX_FPS` entry in `ModeManager`, construct it in `factory.create_mode_instances`, and register a renderer in `registry.build_mode_registry`.

## Web UI, AI control & scripting

These are opt-in subsystems layered on the core loop; none run unless enabled by env vars.

- **Web UI** (`ENABLE_WEB_UI=true`): a FastAPI server (`app/infrastructure/web_server.py`) started lazily *after* the first panel update (so cold web-stack import never delays first pixels). It mirrors the live frame to browsers over `/ws` (WebSocket) and `/api/frame`, accepts browser pointer/click/action input, and exposes REST APIs for the **board** mode (drawing, text/image objects, saved boards), sleep schedule, font preview, scripts, chat, and controller metrics. Pages: `/` (console), `/chat`, `/scripts`, `/font-grid`, `/controller-metrics`. Binds loopback (`WEB_UI_HOST=127.0.0.1`) by default.
- **MCP server** (`app/infrastructure/mcp_server.py`, `ENABLE_MCP=true` by default): a `FastMCP` instance exposing the display to AI agents as tools (`get_display` returns the panel as ASCII art, `set_mode`, board drawing, `run_script`, etc.). The same object backs two consumers: the in-UI chat (in-process) and the external HTTP `/mcp` endpoint. **`/mcp` is only mounted when `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set** and is bearer-gated + DNS-rebinding-protected; the in-UI chat works without it.
- **In-UI AI chat** (`app/infrastructure/chat.py` + `chat_openai.py`): the backend runs the agentic tool-use loop itself as the MCP client and streams NDJSON back to `/chat`. Three providers, keyed by env var: Anthropic (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; Claude Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 / Haiku 4.5), OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`; GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.4 mini/nano), and OpenRouter (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; DeepSeek V4 Flash, GLM-5.2). The model registry lives in `chat.MODELS`; models whose provider has no key show as unavailable in the UI. Default model `claude-opus-4-8` (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` override). **The model is locked per conversation** (histories are provider-native; start a new chat to switch). Token usage and cost are accumulated per turn and per session (OpenRouter cost comes from the API's usage accounting, not a static rate table). Conversations persist to `state/chat_sessions/`.
- **Scripted animations** (`script` mode + `app/services/sandbox.py`): LLM- or user-authored Python frame generators (`setup`/`step` returning `(state, frame)`). Sandboxed in **four layers** — AST allow-list (only `numpy`/`math`/`random`), `bubblewrap` OS isolation (no network/filesystem, fails closed if `bwrap` is missing), a restricted-builtins subprocess, and rlimits + per-frame timeouts. Only a shape-checked `uint8` buffer crosses back. Tunable via `SANDBOX_*` env vars. Saved scripts live in `state/scripts/`.

## Project-specific conventions

- **Drawing = direct numpy indexing.** Set/XOR pixels by slicing the frame: `frame[row*8:row*8+7, 0:slice] ^= 1`. Menu rows are 8px tall (`row*8`). See `menu.py` `Checkbox.draw` and `clock.py` `update_frame`. For geometry (lines, circles, points) use the clipping-safe helpers in `app/services/draw.py` instead of hand-rolling Bresenham.
- **Text** uses a hand-coded bitmap font in `text.py`. Render with `text.write(frame, str, x=, y=, size=5|6, style=)`. Only glyphs present in the font tables exist — add new bitmaps there if needed.
- **Transitions** in `transition.py` operate on frames: `blend(a, b, alpha)`, `resolve`/`disolve(dots, alpha)` use random pixel masks (no greyscale — display is 1-bit).
- **Interaction is dwell-based**, not clicks: hover the right index finger over a `MenuItem` for `CLICK_TIME` (2s) to trigger `on_click`. `human_pose.is_arms_crossed` held for 2s opens the menu via `mode_manager.click_menu()`. With a controller connected, the same modes are driven by `ControllerInputBridge` instead (`toggle_menu`, buttons, etc.).
- Mode classes that need to switch modes take `mode_manager` in their constructor and call `mode_manager.set_mode(...)` (see `Menu`, `factory.create_mode_instances`).

## Code quality standards

These apply to all new and modified code; tooling enforces them (see "Quality gate" below).

**Documentation**
- Every module, public class, and public function/method has a docstring: a concise one-line imperative summary (e.g. "Decide the active mode from pose state."). Add `Args:`/`Returns:`/`Raises:` blocks only when the signature isn't self-explanatory. Private helpers (`_name`) may skip docstrings when the name and types are obvious.
- JS: document every exported/top-level function with a JSDoc block (`@param`, `@returns`). Trivial DOM-wiring one-liners may be skipped.
- Comments explain **why**, not what. Delete commented-out code rather than shipping it.

**Type hints (Python)**
- Annotate every function signature — all parameters and the return type (including `-> None`). Annotate non-obvious module/class attributes.
- Reuse the `Frame = np.ndarray` alias from `app/modes/contracts.py` instead of bare `np.ndarray`; add new aliases for other repeated shapes.
- Prefer precise types. Reserve `Any` for genuinely dynamic third-party objects (MediaPipe pose/face results). Use `Optional[...]` / `| None` for nullable values — pose results can be `None` (see Gotchas).

**Formatting & style**
- Python is formatted and linted by **Ruff** (line length 100, double quotes; rules pyflakes/pycodestyle/isort/pyupgrade/bugbear). Imports group stdlib / third-party / local. `flipPyDot` and `web_ui/vendor` are excluded.
- JS/CSS/HTML are formatted by **Prettier**; JS is linted by **ESLint**. `web_ui/vendor/` is excluded.
- No magic numbers in logic — name constants as class/module-level uppercase (follow `ModeManager.MAX_FPS`, `Paint.CLICK_TIME`). Never hardcode panel dimensions; use `Panel.WIDTH`/`Panel.HEIGHT`.

**Logging & errors**
- Use the module logger (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`); never `print` in `app/`. Choose levels deliberately: DEBUG per-frame, INFO lifecycle, WARNING/ERROR for failures.
- Catch specific exceptions, not bare `except:`. Don't swallow errors silently — log with context.

**Structure & tests**
- Keep functions small and single-purpose; extract when a function does several things or exceeds ~50 lines.
- New behavior ships with a `tests/` test mirroring the source layout (`tests/core`, `tests/infrastructure`, `tests/modes`, `tests/services`). Tests must run without hardware, network, or model files (see `tests/conftest.py`). Browser-facing UI behavior is covered by Playwright specs in `web_ui/tests/`.

**Quality gate** — run before considering work done:
```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy app && pipenv run pytest
npx --prefix web_ui prettier --check web_ui && npx --prefix web_ui eslint web_ui
```
mypy is gradual (`disallow_untyped_defs=false`) and checks the `app` package. `pytest` enforces `--cov-fail-under=40` on `app`.

## Hardware & environment

- **Device:** NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (aarch64), JetPack R36.4.7, running Ubuntu with Python 3.10.
- **Hardware deps:** real serial flip-dot panel at `/dev/ttyUSB0` (57600 baud), a V4L2 webcam at `/dev/video0`, and (optionally) Bluetooth/HID game controllers read via `evdev`.
- Run with `PREVIEW=true` to use `flippydot`'s on-screen pygame preview instead of serial — essential for dev without hardware.
- **Config via `.env`** (loaded by `python-dotenv`). Common keys:
  - Core: `CAMERA_INDEX`, `PREVIEW`, `DEBUG`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `SLEEP_HOUR_START`/`SLEEP_HOUR_END`, `FOCAL_SCALE`.
  - Web/AI: `ENABLE_WEB_UI`, `WEB_UI_HOST`, `WEB_UI_PORT`, `WEB_UI_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `ENABLE_MCP`, `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
  - Controllers: `PRIMARY_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS`/`PRIMARY_CONTROLLER_NAME`, `SECONDARY_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS` (no defaults — a hub with neither an address nor a name hint matches no device and stays idle). BLE link tuning applied after each connect: `CONTROLLER_SUPERVISION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 2000; 0 disables the LE Connection Update), `CONTROLLER_CONN_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`/`CONTROLLER_CONN_MAX_INTERVAL_MS` (default 15/30) — a longer supervision timeout lets weak controllers ride through brief signal fades instead of dropping.
  - Integrations: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, `WEATHER_CITY`/`WEATHER_COUNTRY_CODE` (weather; default Berlin/DE), `API_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` (worldcup).
  - Sandbox/models: `SANDBOX_MEM_MB`, `SANDBOX_CPU_SECONDS`, `SANDBOX_NPROC`, `SANDBOX_FRAME_TIMEOUT`, `SANDBOX_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`, `SANDBOX_MAX_SOURCE_BYTES`, `MEDIAPIPE_MODELS_DIR`, `POSE_MODEL`, `HAIR_SEGMENT_MAX_FPS`.
  - `DEBUG=true` overlays distance/angle text on the bottom rows; `LOG_LEVEL` controls logging verbosity (default `INFO`, set `DEBUG` for per-second performance logs).

## Installed software on the Jetson

- **Python 3.10** (`/usr/bin/python3`) — packages installed system-wide via `pip3`, **not pipenv**.
- **mediapipe 0.10.23+gpu** — a custom **GPU-enabled wheel** built from source on the device (`~/mediapipe`, wheel in `~/mediapipe/dist/`); `pip3 install mediapipe==0.10.18` restores the stock CPU-only wheel if needed. `human_pose.py` requests the GPU (GLES) delegate first and falls back to CPU, so the same code runs on dev machines with the stock wheel. On the Jetson the GPU delegate runs pose inference ~5× faster than CPU/XNNPACK (heavy model: 42 ms vs 208 ms per frame) via a headless EGL context (works under systemd, no X needed); startup takes ~9 s longer for one-time shader compilation. Rebuild recipe: bazel 6.5.0 + protoc 25.5 in `~/bin`/`~/tools`, `MEDIAPIPE_DISABLE_GPU=0`, system OpenCV via `--link-opencv` (the from-source OpenCV build fails on Ubuntu 22.04), `link_opencv` defaulted to `True` in `setup.py` (bdist_wheel reinitializes commands and loses the CLI flag), uncommented `/usr/include/opencv4` paths in `third_party/opencv_linux.BUILD`, and `git checkout -- mediapipe/__init__.py` before rebuilding (failed runs leave it version-injected multiple times, which breaks the wheel's imports). Model files live in `~/flipdot/models/` on the Jetson (`MEDIAPIPE_MODELS_DIR` overrides; excluded from rsync and `.gitignore`). If model files are absent (e.g. on a dev machine) the code automatically falls back to the legacy `mp.solutions.pose` API, so local development works without them. The caricature mode's hair rendering additionally uses MediaPipe's dedicated hair segmenter (`hair_segmenter.tflite`, initialized lazily on its worker thread by `app/services/hair_segmentation.py` — GPU delegate first, 21 ms vs 57 ms on CPU; throttled via `HAIR_SEGMENT_MAX_FPS`, default 7); if that model is missing, hair is skipped with a single warning. The previously used multiclass selfie segmenter (`selfie_multiclass_256x256.tflite`) cannot run on the GLES delegate (non-delegable ops) and took 427 ms/frame on CPU.
- **TensorRT 10.3.0** — pre-installed with JetPack; unused now that the MediaPipe GPU (GLES) delegate is wired up.
- **bubblewrap (`bwrap`)** — required for the script sandbox; if absent, scripts refuse to run (fail closed).
- **opencv-python, pyserial, requests, pillow, python-dotenv, fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, evdev, mcp, anthropic, openai** — installed via pip3.

## SSH access

```bash
ssh flipdot          # connects as flipdot@flipdot (host alias in ~/.ssh/config)
```

Useful commands on the device:
```bash
sudo systemctl status flipdot.service   # check if running
sudo systemctl restart flipdot.service  # restart after deploy
sudo tail -f /var/log/flipdot/output.log   # app INFO/DEBUG logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/flipdot/error.log    # tracebacks and stderr
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/flipdot # force log rotation check
```

## Developer workflows

- **Run locally (dev machine):** `PREVIEW=true python3 flipdot.py` (add `ENABLE_WEB_UI=true` to bring up the browser console on http://127.0.0.1:8000).
- **Run tests locally:** `pipenv run pytest` (Python, from repo root) and `npx --prefix web_ui playwright test` (browser UI). Tests run without hardware/network and avoid hard dependency on MediaPipe model files.
- **Lint / format / type-check:** `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .` (Python), `mypy app` (types), `npx --prefix web_ui prettier --check web_ui` and `npx --prefix web_ui eslint web_ui` (JS). See "Code quality standards" for the full gate. `ruff check --fix .` and `ruff format .` auto-apply most fixes.
- **Run on device:** `sudo systemctl start flipdot.service`; the service auto-restarts on crash (`Restart=always`).
- **Deploy:** `./deploy.sh [--debug]` — rsyncs to `flipdot@flipdot:/home/flipdot/flipdot` (with `--delete`, but `.env`, `state/`, and `models/` are excluded), sets `DEBUG` in `.env`, ensures `state/` and `/var/log/flipdot` exist, pip-installs any missing web/AI deps (`python-multipart`, `mcp`, `anthropic`, `openai`), installs the systemd units (`flipdot.service`, `flipdot-bluetooth-ertm.service`), the udev rule that disables the onboard Bluetooth radio (`ops/udev/99-flipdot-disable-onboard-bt.rules`, so the external UB500 Plus dongle is the sole adapter), and the logrotate config, then reloads and restarts the services. The Bluetooth unit disables ERTM, which otherwise causes multi-second input freezes with BR/EDR HID game controllers.
  - **Important:** the `models/` directory is excluded from rsync. MediaPipe `.task` model files must be downloaded manually once:
    ```bash
    ssh flipdot
    mkdir -p ~/flipdot/models && cd ~/flipdot/models
    wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/pose_landmarker/pose_landmarker_heavy/float16/latest/pose_landmarker_heavy.task
    wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/latest/face_landmarker.task
    wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/image_segmenter/hair_segmenter/float32/latest/hair_segmenter.tflite
    ```

## Gotchas

- `weather.py` reads OpenWeatherMap credentials from `.env`; missing `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` returns an error payload instead of forecast data.
- Frames are 1-bit: anything you draw must end up as 0/1 `uint8`. Segmentation masks etc. must be thresholded (`(x > 0.5).astype(np.uint8)`).
- Pose results can be `None` — guard `pose_results.pose_landmarks` before use, as the main loop does. Pose is also `None` whenever inference was skipped (sleep hours, controller-driven UI mode, running script).
- The web UI and `/mcp` bind to loopback by default; the external `/mcp` endpoint stays disabled until `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, even when `ENABLE_MCP` is true.
- Sandboxed scripts run a *separate* `python -c` worker (not `multiprocessing`) so they import only numpy — never the host's heavy stack. Changing that would drag ~1 GB of libraries into the worker and break its memory rlimit.
